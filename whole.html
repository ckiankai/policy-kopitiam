      <h2 class="center reveal-soft">What it is, in one minute</h2>

      <p class="reveal-fast">
        Whole life insurance provides coverage for your entire life, subject to policy terms and premiums being paid as agreed.
        It usually includes a savings structure inside the policy, which affects what happens if you keep it long-term or exit early.

        <h3>What it is trying to do</h3>
        <p>
          Term insurance solves protection for a specific window.
          Whole life exists for people who want protection that does not expire,
          especially when it is hard to predict future needs or discipline over decades.

      <p class="reveal-fast">
        Whole life adds extra structure compared to term.
        That structure is the reason premiums are higher, and also the reason whole life behaves differently over time.
      </p>

      <div class="two-col reveal-fast">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Cash value</h3>
          <p>
            Whole life policies accumulate an internal
            <span class="gloss" data-term="cash-value">cash value</span>
            over time.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            This is not a separate investment account.
            It is a policy construct that reflects how the plan is designed to work over decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cash value influences the policy’s options later on,
            including surrender outcomes, paid-up conversion, and policy loans.
            Practically, it changes the feel of the policy,
            you are not only paying for risk transfer, you are paying for a long-run structure.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Surrender and paid-up options</h3>
          <p>
            Exiting early may result in a
            <span class="gloss" data-term="surrender-value">surrender value</span>,
            or conversion to a reduced paid-up policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because whole life is built for long time horizons,
            surrendering early can mean receiving less than the total premiums paid,
            especially in the first years when costs are front-loaded.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">

      <h2 class="center reveal-soft">Guarantees vs non-guarantees</h2>

      <p class="reveal-fast">
        Many whole life plans separate outcomes into a guaranteed portion and a non-guaranteed portion.
        This is one reason whole life discussions can feel confusing, the illustration shows multiple layers of certainty.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal-fast">
        The split exists to balance certainty with long-run sustainability.
        Fully guaranteeing everything would usually raise premiums sharply,
        fully variable outcomes would remove the certainty many people are paying for.

  <h2 class="center reveal-soft">Participating (PAR) vs Non-Participating (Non-PAR)</h2>

  <p class="reveal-fast">
    Some whole life policies participate in the insurer’s long-term participating fund, others do not.
    This choice mainly affects how uncertainty is shared, not whether the policy “works”.
  </p>

  <div class="two-col reveal-fast">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Participating (PAR)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>benefits usually split into guaranteed and non-guaranteed portions</li>
        <li>non-guaranteed bonuses depend on insurer participating fund performance</li>
        <li>outcomes are often smoothed over time, not tied to short-term market swings</li>
        <li>more variability by design, in exchange for sharing in surplus</li>

      <ul>

      <div class="note reveal-fast">
    <p><strong>So should I choose PAR or Non-PAR?</strong></p>

    <p>
      This usually comes down to how much variability you are comfortable living with over a long time.
      PAR policies trade some certainty for participation in a shared fund,
      while Non-PAR policies trade that participation for clearer, fully defined outcomes.
      Because PAR policies include this additional sharing mechanism,
      their premiums are often higher than comparable Non-PAR designs.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      A useful way to think about it is not “which pays more”,
      but whether you prefer a bounded result you can see upfront,
      or a structure where part of the outcome evolves over time.

  <h2 class="center reveal-soft">Strengths and weaknesses</h2>

  <p class="reveal-fast">
    Whole life insurance is built around permanence.
    It is not designed to win on cost per dollar of coverage,
    it is designed to make protection persist without needing to be re-decided later.
    That trade-off is the core of both its appeal and its friction.
  </p>

  <div class="two-col reveal-fast">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>coverage is designed to last for life</li>
        <li>guaranteed components create a clearer long-term floor</li>
        <li>built-in commitment reduces the need to revisit decisions</li>
        <li>less exposure to market swings compared to investment-linked products</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Whole life feels “reassuring” when you value certainty and continuity.
        You are paying more upfront to reduce future decision risk.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>higher premiums than pure protection products</li>
        <li>less flexible if your needs or priorities change</li>
        <li>early surrender is usually inefficient</li>
        <li>not designed to maximise investment returns</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Whole life feels “expensive” when you only need coverage for a fixed window.
        Permanence becomes a cost rather than a benefit.
