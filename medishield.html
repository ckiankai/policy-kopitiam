      <h2 class="center reveal-soft">What it is, in one minute</h2>

      <p class="reveal-fast">
        MediShield Life is Singapore’s basic national health insurance.
        It helps pay for <strong>large hospital bills</strong> and <strong>selected costly outpatient treatments</strong>, so you use less MediSave or cash.
        The key word is large, it is not meant to cover everything, and it is not meant to make healthcare feel free.
      </p>

      <div class="card reveal-fast">
        <h3>Who is covered?</h3>
        <p>
       All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are automatically covered,
      and coverage continues regardless of age or health conditions.
       </p>
    </div>

      <div class="card reveal-fast">
        <h3>Floor, not ceiling</h3>
        <p>
          If you understand MediShield Life first, everything else becomes easier.
          Integrated Shield Plans and riders are best understood as optional layers that modify gaps or comfort,
          they are not “replacements” for the base layer.
        </p>
    </section>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <!-- why exists -->
    <section class="chapter wash wash-green" id="why-exists">
      <h2 class="center reveal-soft">Why MediShield Life exists</h2>

      <p class="reveal-fast">
        Serious illness is both a health shock and a financial shock.
        Bills can be large, sudden, and poorly timed, especially if the illness reduces your ability to work.
        MediShield Life exists to reduce the chance that one medical episode becomes long-term financial damage.
      </p>

      <div class="two-col reveal-fast">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>The problem it solves</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            A rare event for an individual can still be common across a population.
            If costs are concentrated on the unlucky few, the outcome can be catastrophic.
          </p>
          <p>
            MediShield Life spreads that risk so that the cost of bad luck is shared across many people over time.
            This is the logic of social insurance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>What it is not trying to do</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            It is not trying to eliminate every out-of-pocket dollar.
            It is not trying to subsidise comfort preferences for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it tried to cover everything, premiums would rise sharply for everyone,
            including those who can least afford it.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="note reveal-fast">
        <p>
          A national scheme usually draws a line between medical necessity and personal preference.
          MediShield Life sits on the necessity side of that line.

        </span>subsidised care in public hospitals</span>
      </h2>

      <p class="reveal-fast">
        MediShield Life benefits are sized around subsidised treatment in public hospitals.
        This is why ward classes like B2 or C keep showing up in discussions,
        they are used as the benchmark when sizing payouts.

          <h3>If you choose higher comfort</h3>
          <p>
            You are still covered, but MediShield Life usually covers a smaller share of the total bill.
            The remainder is paid using MediSave and cash.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            This is the practical origin of “gaps”, not because MediShield is broken, but because the bill structure changed.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>This is intentional</h3>
          <p>
            Comfort is treated as a personal preference.
            The national scheme is designed to make necessary care financially survivable,
            not to guarantee private-room comfort by default.

        A lot of confusion disappears once you accept this,
        MediShield Life is designed to cover medical necessity,
        not daily healthcare, and not lifestyle preferences.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal-fast">
        MediShield Life uses cost-sharing.
        That means you usually pay part of the bill even when insured.
        This is not a flaw, it is how the scheme keeps premiums sustainable and usage sensible.
      </p>

      <div class="card reveal-fast">
          <h3>Maximum claim limits</h3>
          <p>
            MediShield Life has claim limits by service type and stay length, and an overall cap, the maximum claim limit per policy year is $200,000, and there is no lifetime limit.

            The <span class="gloss" data-term="deductible">deductible</span> is the amount you pay first in a policy year
            before MediShield Life starts paying.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Think of it as a threshold that filters out smaller bills, and focuses insurance on large, disruptive ones.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Co-insurance</h3>
          <p>
            After the deductible, you still pay a percentage of the remaining claimable amount.
            This is the co-insurance portion.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            The point is not to punish patients, it is to avoid the system behaving like “free consumption”,
            which tends to push costs up for everyone.

      </div>

      <div class="note reveal-fast">
        <p>
          A practical way to think about it:
          MediShield Life is meant to protect you from the tail risk, the huge bills,
          not to remove every bit of discomfort from the process.

    <section class="chapter wash wash-green" id="lifelong">
      <h2 class="center reveal-soft">Why coverage is lifelong</h2>

      <p class="reveal-fast">
        Health risks rise with age, and so do medical costs.
        If coverage ended at older ages, insurance would disappear exactly when people need it most.
        MediShield Life solves this by being lifelong, it continues regardless of age or health status.
      </p>

      <div class="two-col reveal-fast">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Universal means no cherry picking</h3>
          <p>
            Everyone is in, including those with pre-existing conditions.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Lifelong does not mean free</h3>

            Premiums reflect risk, and risk rises with age.

  <div class="card reveal-fast">

      MediShield Life provides a baseline level of protection, focused on subsidised care and large bills.
