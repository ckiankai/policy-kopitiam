Why this site exists

I built Policy Kopitiam because I was confused about insurance myself.

Despite studying economics, actuarial science, and insurance-related material in school and internships, I realised that understanding insurance in theory is very different from understanding how it actually works in practice. Concepts like risk pooling, deductibles, co-payments, and coverage limits make sense on paper, but become harder to reason about when applied to real decisions.

This site is my attempt to bridge that gap.

It is a way to organise what I have learned academically and through industry exposure, and to explain insurance mechanics in plain language, without sales pressure, rankings, or recommendations. Writing it forced me to slow down, clarify assumptions, and test whether I truly understood the ideas beyond definitions and formulas.

Policy Kopitiam exists to help readers (and myself!) build a clearer mental model of how insurance works, so they can ask better questions and make more informed decisions elsewhere.
